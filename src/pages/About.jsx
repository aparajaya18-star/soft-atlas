            Soft Atlas is a personal travel journal created to document places that
            leave a lasting impression. Rather than fast-paced itineraries, this
            space focuses on slower experiences — cities, landscapes, and moments
            that feel grounding.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each destination shared here reflects a sense of calm, curiosity, and
            attention to detail. From busy streets to quiet corners, Soft Atlas
            grows as a collection of places that invite pause rather than urgency.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project continues to evolve with every journey. Soft Atlas is
            meant to be revisited — a record of movement, memory, and stillness
            over time.
          </p>

          <p className="about-signature">
            Created as a personal archive, Soft Atlas reflects the way I experience
            travel — slowly, observantly, and with an appreciation for quiet detail.
