          Soft Atlas is a personal travel journal created to document places that
          leave a lasting impression. Rather than fast-paced itineraries, this
          space focuses on slower experiences — cities, landscapes, and moments
          that feel grounding.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each destination shared here reflects a sense of calm, curiosity, and
          appreciation for culture, nature, and everyday beauty. From busy
          streets to quiet corners, this atlas grows with every journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project is still evolving, just like travel itself. Soft Atlas is
          a space to pause, reflect, and collect stories along the way.
