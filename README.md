Soft Atlas

A quiet collection of places, moments, and memories.

Soft Atlas is a personal travel journal built with React, focusing on slower travel experiences, visual storytelling, and calm, minimal design.

Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a multi-stage web development assignment, gradually evolving from a static website into a fully component-based React application with basic backend integration.

Task 2 – Website Building (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

For Task 2, I designed and built a multi-page travel blog website with Home, About, and Contact pages. The focus was on layout structure, visual hierarchy, and responsiveness. The project was hosted using GitHub Pages and followed a clean, content-first design approach.

Theme: Travel Blog
Pages: Home, About, Contact

Task 3 – React Conversion & Component Structure

In Task 3, the entire project was converted into React. The website was broken down into reusable components, and React Router was used to manage navigation between pages. Destination data was centralized and dynamically rendered across the Home and Atlas pages, with destinations sorted by visit date and the three most recent entries displayed on the Home page.

Task 4 – Beginner Node.js Integration

For Task 4, a simple Node.js + Express backend was created to demonstrate frontend–backend communication. A GET API endpoint returns sample JSON data, which is fetched in the React frontend and displayed on the Home page, confirming successful integration.
