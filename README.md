# Soft Atlas

A quiet collection of places, moments, and memories.

Soft Atlas is a personal travel journal built with React, designed around slower travel, visual storytelling, and calm, minimal interactions. It explores how technology can document experiences gently, without noise or urgency.

## Project Overview

Soft Atlas began as a static travel blog and gradually evolved into a full-stack web project. Over multiple development stages, it transitioned from a simple HTML/CSS site into a component-driven React application with backend integration, dynamic filtering, and persistent data handling.

The project emphasizes clarity, emotional design, and thoughtful interaction over feature-heavy complexity.

## Development Journey

### Task 2 – Website Building (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

The project started as a multi-page travel blog with Home, About, and Contact pages. The focus was on layout structure, responsive design, and visual hierarchy, using a clean, content-first approach. The site was hosted using GitHub Pages.

**Theme:** Travel Blog  
**Pages:** Home, About, Contact

### Task 3 – React Conversion & Component Structure

The website was fully converted into React and broken into reusable components. React Router was introduced for navigation, and destination data was centralized and dynamically rendered across pages. Destinations are sorted by visit date, with recent entries highlighted on the Home page and the full archive presented in the Atlas.

### Task 4 – Backend Integration (Node.js & Express)

A Node.js + Express backend was added to demonstrate frontend–backend communication. API endpoints were created and consumed from the React frontend, confirming successful data flow and integration.

### Continued Enhancements

Beyond the original assignment scope, the project was expanded with:

- Mood-based destination filters
- A “WanderLust” feature for random discovery
- Persistent visitor count using a deployed backend
- UI polish including subtle animations and highlights
- Separate frontend and backend deployments
